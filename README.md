Hi, I’m Raymond. I’m currently focused on two learning paths:

+ **Operating System Development** as a long-term pursuit.  
+ **Full Stack Web Development** as a short-term goal.  

Alongside these, I also work on side projects such as automation tools and other utilities.

## Operating System Development

I’ve created an organization called **[TheOSDevLab](https://github.com/TheOSDevLab)** to host all my OS development work.  

+ [Crafting an OS: Notes and Insights](https://github.com/TheOSDevLab/Crafting-an-OS-Notes-and-Insights)  
  Notes and reflections from my journey into OS development.

+ [Bare-Metal Assembly](https://github.com/TheOSDevLab/Bare-Metal-Assembly)  
  A collection of notes on x86 Assembly, focused on OS programming.

+ [**C Systems Programming**](https://github.com/TheOSDevLab/C_Systems_Programming)  
  Detailed notes on C for operating system development.

## Full Stack Web Development

I’ve also set up another organization, **[FullStackWebDevLab](https://github.com/FullStackWebDevLab)**, for my web development journey.  

+ [Full Stack Journal](https://github.com/FullStackWebDevLab/FullStackJournal)  
  Notes and insights as I learn full stack web development.

## Side Projects

In addition to structured learning, I build independent side projects.  
These are hosted under my **personal account** and usually focus on automation or experimental ideas.
