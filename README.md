- 🌱 I’m currently learning interrupts, ports, ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building an OS
- 📫 How to reach me: Here's [my email](mailto:raymondmwaura232@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once spent 3 hours debugging a triple fault, only to realize I forgot to load the IDT. I hate myself.

If you’re into low-level dev, let’s break stuff and learn together.

## What I Use

- 🧠 Languages: C, assembly
- ⚙️ Tools: QEMU, `nasm`, `ld`, `make`, pain
- 💻 Distro: Void Linux (because I love pain)
